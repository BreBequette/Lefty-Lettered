# Lefty-Lettered
 
## Overview
Lefty Lettered is a portfolio and contact site for my hand lettering services. Users can see the types of work that I do, learn more about me and get in touch with their own project ideas. It was created for an assignment in a web development course.

## Features
- Hover animations
- Portfolio galleries
- Contact form

## Biggest Challenge
Though I had written plenty of forms and had a basic understanding of how they worked, this was my first time using PHP for form handling. Having never formally learned any PHP, I did a lot of reading and watching before finally figuuring it out.

## Technologies
- Pure HTML/CSS - no front-end frameworks or existing code
- Javascript
- PHP
- Built in DreamWeaver
